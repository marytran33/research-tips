<p class="intro">You’ve spent weeks, months, and maybe even years working on a research project that you are proud of. You know why this project is important and what your next steps will be, but are you prepared to explain all of that to the next person who asks you about your research? 
</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col s12">
<p>It could be your department chair, a potential research advisor, a fellow researcher, or a funding organization. Instead of panicking and not knowing where to begin or stumbling through your research purpose, you should take some time now and create an elevator speech to pitch in these situations. So what is an elevator speech? In a research setting, an elevator speech introduces you as a researcher, your research questions, and the significance of your research. Because an elevator speech is short, typically 30 seconds to 2 minutes, it is a great way to introduce and share your research with others at formal networking events, conferences, casual conversations, or even during an actual elevator ride. 
Ultimately, your elevator speech should provide a ‘hook’ and make your listener want to know more about your research! </p>

<p>You can use a review article to get a better understanding of the existing research on a topic, to identify research questions you would like to explore, and to find relevant sources. A review article’s bibliography often contains references to research articles that have made an impact on the field and advanced understanding of a research topic.

<p>Reading a review article can save you time and give you a more well-rounded and coherent understanding of your topic.</p>

### Basic Components of an Elevator Speech:


### What should be included in an elevator speech? 

Your elevator speech should address the 5 W’s: 
Who
	Introduce your name and your identity as an academic and researcher.  
Example: “My name is...and I’m a second year student at UCLA. I’m interested in history, specifically the early modern period…”
Example: “I’m a senior Biology major and was a research assistant in a lab…” 

What
Think about what do you do. What is your research topic or question? 
Example: “I study…” or “My research project is about…”  or “I’m looking at….” or “I’m interested in ….”

Where
	Where are you pursuing your research? 
Example: “...with a professor in the Psychology Department” or “...as a part of my scholarship program...” 

When
	Include key dates and time periods related to your research.
Example: “I started on this research project…” or “The grant got funded in 20XX” 

Why
	This section is incredibly important and will probably carry the weight of your elevator speech. It answers: Why should your audience care about your research? Why is your research significant? Think about what your research adds to the existing knowledge in your field. What makes it different from previous studies? 
Example: “This project explores an area currently overlooked…” 

### Delivering an Elevator Speech

It’s important to consider whom your audience is when delivering an elevator speech. For instance, it’s a good idea to leave out jargon if you’re pitching your research project to a lay audience as opposed to a group of experts in your field.
